# A machine learning approach to improve RFID gate operation

## Paper materials

<ul>
  <li> rfidml.ipynb is the jupyter notebook for computing the predictive model, evaluate it and simulate the operation of the smartgate versus a normal gate
  <li> modelrfid.h5 are the precomputed weights for the predictive neural network. This network outputs the expected batch identification policy using a given policy for the actual batch
  <li> batches.txt contains the simulatation results from the interrogation of 120000 tag batches with random placement, properties, and antennas selection policies
    </ul>
